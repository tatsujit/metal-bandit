# Scalability Test Progress Report

## Test Results So Far

### Small Scale Test (500 subjects Ã— 4 arms Ã— 200 trials = 400K decisions)

| Method | Execution Time | Memory Used | Throughput | Winner |
|--------|---------------|-------------|------------|---------|
| CPU (1-thread) | 17.59s | 32.6MB | 5,685 decisions/s | |
| CPU (8-threads) | 9.83s | 18.3MB | 10,169 decisions/s | |
| **GPU** | **8.54s** | 22.9MB | 11,704 decisions/s | ðŸ¥‡ |

**Key Findings:**
- GPU achieves 2.06x speedup vs CPU(1-thread)
- GPU achieves 1.15x speedup vs CPU(8-threads)
- GPU is the fastest method at small scale
- Memory usage is moderate across all methods
- All methods achieve 100% parameter recovery success

### Medium Scale Test (1500 subjects Ã— 6 arms Ã— 300 trials = 2.7M decisions)

**CPU Results:**
- CPU (1-thread): 95.51s, 49.9MB, 4,711 decisions/s
- CPU (8-threads): 26.21s, 50.1MB, 17,166 decisions/s
- GPU: **In Progress** (encountered bounds error with 6 arms, investigating...)

**Performance Trends:**
- CPU(8) vs CPU(1) speedup: 3.64x (increasing with scale)
- Memory usage scales linearly with problem size
- Throughput decreasing per decision as complexity increases

## Next Steps

1. Debug GPU implementation for higher arm counts
2. Complete medium scale GPU testing
3. Proceed to large scale testing
4. Analyze memory usage patterns
5. Create comprehensive visualization

## Technical Issues Encountered

- GPU bounds error with 6-arm bandit (fixed with validation)
- Need to ensure GPU kernel handles variable arm counts correctly
