* Key Findings

1. *Threading Performance*: 14-thread optimization provided efficient parameter estimation across all conditions.

2. *Complexity Effects*: Parameter recovery performance varied systematically with environmental complexity.

3. *Stationarity Impact*: Non-stationary environments showed comparable recovery to stationary.

4. *Sample Size Effects*: Larger environments benefited from increased sample sizes for reliable parameter recovery.

* Recommendations

- Use 14 threads for optimal parameter estimation performance
- Consider environmental complexity when planning sample sizes
- Monitor parameter-specific recovery patterns for model validation

* Technical Notes

- All estimations used BFGS optimization with multiple restarts
- Parameter bounds were enforced during optimization
- Results are based on correlations between true and estimated parameters
