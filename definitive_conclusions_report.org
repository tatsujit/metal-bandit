* Executive Summary

After 8 hours of comprehensive large-scale testing with identical BFGS optimization across all methods, we have reached **definitive conclusions** about GPU vs CPU performance for 11-parameter cognitive model estimation.

** ðŸŽ¯ DEFINITIVE CONCLUSION

*GPU wins 2 out of 3 large scales* but **performance differences are negligible** (<5% maximum advantage). The primary finding is that the previous 6-8x CPU advantage was entirely due to **algorithmic bias**, not hardware limitations.

** ðŸ“Š Key Performance Numbers

| Scale | GPU Time | CPU(8) Time | Winner | Advantage | Effect Size |
|-------|----------|-------------|---------|-----------|-------------|
| Large (30K decisions) | 87.1s | 89.4s | **GPU** | 1.026x | Small |
| Very-Large (100K decisions) | 219.6s | 224.9s | **GPU** | 1.024x | Small |
| Massive (250K decisions) | 431.6s | 429.6s | CPU(8) | 1.004x | Negligible |
